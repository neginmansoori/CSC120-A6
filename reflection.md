- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

The superclass greatly simplified the creation of the subclasses and made the process more efficient. An important nuance that I learned was that the commad super() needs to go at the first line of the constructur so that it can run before the constructor sets the values.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Checking the javadoc for Hashtable was very helpful as I could use the methods specific to hashtable to do the operations, and gained more familiarity with their function. I would revisit the cafe, make its inventory more structured and rethink its restocking.
